\subsection{Service discovery} \label{soln:service-discovery}

Service discovery mechanisms are a common pattern in Service-Oriented (or micro-service) Architectures (SOA) that allow dynamically managed (usually virtually hosted) services to `discover' one another like a plumber looking up an electrician in the \emph{Yellow Pages}. 

These are useful for at least delivering a request to the correct place, but typically do not offer anything further by way of validation.

Linkerd,~\cite{service_discovery_linkerd} Consul,~\cite{service_discovery_consul} and Apache Zookeeper~\cite{service_discovery_apache} are examples of such mechanisms.
