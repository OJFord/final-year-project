\subsection{Summary} \label{soln:summary}
RPCs provide a tight-coupling that works excellently when the same user, or company of users, has autonomy over both client and server.

Swagger, by contrast, is essentially zero-coupling, but provides a mechanism for an API vendor to maintain synchrony between their documentation and code. Some client stub generators exist, to some extent `forcing' the user to use correct methods and paths. These seem only to exist for high-level languages, though, and without fully matching the request body to an ADT in the client source language. \cite{swagger_oss}

Thus, there seems to be space for a solution that ties client and server more tightly than existing Swagger tooling, but maintaining the REST resource-access pattern distinct from RPC.

This would allow the solution to meet the specified `soft' requirements \cfref{intro:req:productivity} of not disrupting existing work-flow, while allowing greater scope for detecting errors in client usage of an API, as compared to the referenced server's expectation.
