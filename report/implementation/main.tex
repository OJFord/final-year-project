\section{Implementation} \label{impl}

In this section, to avoid hazy reference to `the implementation' or `our solution', and the name going unexplained in code listings, the working name \emph{tapioca}\footnote{TAPIOCA: Typed APIs that Ollie Coshed into an Acronym.} is used to refer to the library of that ilk~\cite{tapioca} which embodies the implementation of this project.

\subsection{Invocation} \label{impl:invocation}

In order for the programmer using \emph{tapioca} to be able to interact with multiple APIs in the same crate, it is necessary for each invocation of the \mintinline{rust}{infer_api!} macro to generate the Rust interface inside a unique module. For transparency, and to aid productivity through auto-complete and other tooling, \mintinline{rust}{infer_api!} requires this module name as an argument - in addition to a string containing a URL at which to find the associated schema - as shown in \cref{code:impl:invocation}.

\begin{codelisting}{code:impl:invocation}{Example setup for tapioca use}
\begin{spacing}{\codespacing}
\begin{minted}[tabsize=4]{rust}
    extern crate tapioca;
    const UBER_API_SCHEMA: &'static str = // ...
    
    tapioca::infer_api!(uber, UBER_API_SCHEMA);
    // after the macro returns, 'uber' is a module in this crate
    use uber;
    
    fn main() {
        // ...
    }
\end{minted}
\end{spacing}
\end{codelisting}

The macro then downloads the schema file, and caches it locally. This method of obtaining the schema was a design decision made to reflect that the adherence of client software's API usage to the schema is intended to be adherence to the API offered by the server. Thus, the schema should not be a file created by the user - it should be one provided by the provider of the API that he wishes to use.
