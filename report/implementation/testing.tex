\subsection{Testing} \label{impl:testing}

A suite of sample schemata is used in integration testing, against which we try to compile test cases of both the `should compile' and `should fail to compile' varieties. This provides not only a benchmark for identifying regression, but also tracking of implemented features.

A successful test is one that either:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Contains a sample program exhibiting \emph{correct} API use, and compilation \emph{succeeds};
	\item Contains a sample program that attempts to use an API in a manner \emph{not} permitted by the schema, and compilation \emph{fails}.
\end{enumerate}

Fuzzing is used in order to prevent `over-fitting' to the test cases.

!TODO: much more.
