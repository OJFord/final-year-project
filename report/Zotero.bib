@inproceedings{lambda_xgc,
  title = {Preservation of {{Strong Normalisation}} in {{Named Lambda Calculi}} with {{Explicit Substitution}} and {{Garbage Collection}}},
  abstract = {In this paper we introduce and study a new lambda-calculus with explicit substitution, lambda-xgc, which has two distinguishing features: first, it retains the use of traditional variable names, specifying terms modulo renaming; this simplifies the reduction system. Second, it includes reduction rules for explicit garbage collection; this simplifies several proofs. We show that lambda-xgc is a conservative extension which preserves strong normalisation (PSN) of the untyped lambda-calculus. The result is obtained in a modular way by first proving it for garbage-free reduction and then extending to `reductions in garbage'. This provides insight into the counterexample to PSN for lambda-sigma of Melliès (1995); we exploit the abstract nature of lambda-xgc to show how PSN is in conflict with any reasonable substitution composition rule (except for trivial composition rules of which we mention one).  Key words: lambda calculus, explicit substitution, strong normalisation, garbage collection.},
