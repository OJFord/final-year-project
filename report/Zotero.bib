@inproceedings{lambda_xgc,
  title = {Preservation of {{Strong Normalisation}} in {{Named Lambda Calculi}} with {{Explicit Substitution}} and {{Garbage Collection}}},
  abstract = {In this paper we introduce and study a new lambda-calculus with explicit substitution, lambda-xgc, which has two distinguishing features: first, it retains the use of traditional variable names, specifying terms modulo renaming; this simplifies the reduction system. Second, it includes reduction rules for explicit garbage collection; this simplifies several proofs. We show that lambda-xgc is a conservative extension which preserves strong normalisation (PSN) of the untyped lambda-calculus. The result is obtained in a modular way by first proving it for garbage-free reduction and then extending to `reductions in garbage'. This provides insight into the counterexample to PSN for lambda-sigma of Melliès (1995); we exploit the abstract nature of lambda-xgc to show how PSN is in conflict with any reasonable substitution composition rule (except for trivial composition rules of which we mention one).  Key words: lambda calculus, explicit substitution, strong normalisation, garbage collection.},

  abstract = {Software for commercial aircraft is subject to the stringent certification processes described in the DO-178B standard, "Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification." Issued in 1992, this document focuses strongly on the verification process, with a major emphasis on testing. In 2005, the avionics industry initiated an effort to update DO-178B, in large part to accommodate development practices (including formal verification techniques) that had matured since its publication. A revised standard, DO-178C, was issued in late 2011, incorporating new guidance that allows formal verification to replace certain forms of testing. In this article, the authors describe some of the new objectives and activities in the area of formal methods, explain how these methods may be used instead of testing in a DO-178C context, and summarize the practical experience of Dassault-Aviation and Airbus in successfully applying the new DO-178C approach.},
