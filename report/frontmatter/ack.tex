I am very grateful to all of the lecturers I have encountered throughout my four years at Imperial. Even where not explicitly cited, and where I may be unconscious of it, I have no doubt that their lectures have influenced my approach to and understanding of this project; even those seemingly unrelated.

In particular, I would like to thank my supervisor, both of this project and an industrial placement that preceded and inspired it, Dr Tom Clarke, whose feedback from an early stage has helped to shape and refine the scope of my intentions considerably.
